## Blogr Landing Page - Frontendmentor.io Challenge Solution

This is my solution for the Frontendmentor.io challenge **Blogr Landing Page** 

## Setup 

This project has been setup using Vite + React. 
I am using Tailwind CSS as my style framework. 

## Not feelign it

not feeling this project right now, so, pushing, all files set up, fonts installed. components made, some text added. hmm. will return to this later.
